# Patient cards Triage

Welcome to our new **coding challenge**.
During this session of ~2h, we will evaluate your code skills on multiple aspects of the front end world!!
It is important to read all the instructions before to start your ⏱!

## Instructions
We are trying to build a Triage Patient's cards that can move cards from the TODO column to the DONE column
  - Fetch the patient cards using our local server
  - Display the patient cards in the corresponding column ( _Todo_ or _Done_ )
  - Change card status from _Todo_ to _Done_ and the other way around.
  - Filter them by patient name and arythmias.

A particular attention will be taken to your Code Structure, your hability to express data models and UI components structure.

## Requirements
You can choose **any** of the following solution but we expect to have a clean file structure in your final project.

Setup your project with one of our project CLI recommendations
- Angular [cli](https://cli.angular.io/)
- React [reactApp](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)
- VueJS [vuecli](https://cli.vuejs.org/)
- Vanilla

Of course, you are free to use any of the CSS naming convention/methodology, or any testing libraries other than the one provided by the CLI.

## Design specs
Because no feature is develop without a nice pseudo-design here is a rapid sketch of how we think we can display the list..

 > Go, let express your creativity !!

## Bonus points
- UI/UX design
- Offline card filtering
- Writing unittests
- Css animations
- Using Typescript

Go ahead with new suggestions for a V2.

## Server
Here is a simple instructions on how to setup your local server for the project

1. first install the node dependencies
    `npm install`

2. run the local API server
    `npm run api`

3. everything is setup you can now access the list of cards with the following url:
    `GET http://localhost:3000/cards`

## Share your project
Create a new github project and share your work with us

## Good Luck and HAVE FUN!!
